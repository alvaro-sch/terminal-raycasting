# Unnamed doomlike
A dumb doomlike simulation in ascii graphics. Written in ncurses.

## Building
```
make <all|clean|run> <T=[,debug,release]>
```

## Controls
I'm too lazy to add some sort of config, but may reconsider later
- wasd: move accordingly to player angle
- t: toggle view (topdown | raycasting)
- q: rotate ccw
- r: rotate cw
- p: quit

## TODO
- Add the actual ray casting
- Add a sort of camera for larger maps
